        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6">
          As a web developer, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and
          pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. My journey in
          web development started with a simple curiosity about how websites
          work, and has evolved into a passion for creating intuitive,
          user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me learning about new web
          technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or helping other
          developers in the community.
